## Task 2, Working in Pairs  

- In this directory you will find the files needed to complete task2. 
- stockmarket.py is a simple web app built with Streamlit (Go team Git Commit Fraud)  
  that allows a user to click on a company's logo and see a chart for its stock's price.  

- You're tasked with improving the app by implementing the 6 features described in the beginning of the file.  
- There are 2 features labeled #E for easy, 2 labeled #M for medium and 2 labeled #H for hard so you should split them evenly between the two of you.  

## Useful commands
- Before starting you should run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in your terminal to install all the dependencies needed for the app to run.  
- Another command you'll be using a lot is streamlit run 'path/to/stockmarket.py' to actually run the app.  

> *Note: The suggested improvements are the minimum needed to complete the task. Any other improvements you can think of and implement will only count positively towards your grade and are to your benefit. Just make sure the code is properly documented and you make use of good git practices.
